PetesPhotos
===========

This is a single page application I built to display my photographs from Flickr. 

It uses backbone.js as the MVC framework and a theme from HTML5 UP http://html5up.net/ to make it look pretty. 

A backbone collection is created using the Flickr feed and used to populate views. 

By default the Flickr API provides only thumbnail images but with some jiggery pokery and the help of their documentation the URL can be changed to get larger sizes (https://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.urls.html)
